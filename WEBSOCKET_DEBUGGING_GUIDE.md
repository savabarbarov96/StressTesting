# WebSocket Debugging Guide

## Overview

This document outlines the improvements made to separate the WebSocket server from the main backend API and add comprehensive debugging to identify and resolve real-time data issues during load testing.

## Changes Made

### 1. WebSocket Server Separation

**Problem**: WebSocket connections were running on the same port as the main API server (3001), causing conflicts during load testing.

**Solution**: Created a separate WebSocket server running on port 3002.

#### Files Modified:
- `backend/src/config/index.ts` - Added `websocketPort` configuration
- `backend/src/websocket-server.ts` - New separate WebSocket server class
- `backend/src/server.ts` - Updated to use separate WebSocket server
- `frontend/src/services/socket.ts` - Updated to connect to separate WebSocket port

#### Configuration:
- Backend API: Port 3001 (configurable via `PORT` env var)
- WebSocket Server: Port 3002 (configurable via `WEBSOCKET_PORT` env var)
- Frontend connects to both ports separately

### 2. Comprehensive Debugging

Added extensive logging throughout the system to track the flow of data:

#### Backend Debugging:
- **RunManager**: Logs when events are received from workers and emitted to WebSocket
- **WebSocket Server**: Logs when events are received from RunManager and broadcast to clients
- **Load Worker**: Logs when messages are sent to RunManager
- **Server Initialization**: Logs the startup sequence and WebSocket connection

#### Key Debug Points:
1. Worker creation and message sending
2. RunManager message reception and event emission
3. WebSocket server event reception and broadcasting
4. Client connection and room joining

### 3. Event Flow Verification

The complete event flow is now logged:

```
Worker â†’ RunManager â†’ WebSocket Server â†’ Frontend Client
```

Each step logs:
- Message type (progress, log, complete, error)
- Run ID
- Data payload
- Timestamp

### 4. Test Infrastructure

#### Test Endpoint:
- `POST /api/test-websocket` - Emits a test event to verify WebSocket connectivity

#### Test Script:
- `backend/test-load-system.js` - Standalone test to verify the entire load testing system

## Debugging Steps

### 1. Check Server Startup
Look for these logs when starting the backend:
```
âœ… RunManager initialized
ðŸ”Œ WebSocket server created, setting up handlers...
ðŸ”Œ WebSocket handlers configured
ðŸ”Œ RunManager event listeners configured
ðŸ”Œ WebSocket server running on port 3002
âœ… WebSocket server initialized and connected to RunManager
```

### 2. Check Frontend Connection
Look for these logs in the browser console:
```
ðŸ”Œ Attempting to connect to backend: http://localhost:3001
ðŸ”Œ Attempting to connect to WebSocket: http://localhost:3002
âœ… Connected to main socket
âœ… Connected to runs namespace
```

### 3. Check Load Test Execution
When starting a load test, look for:

**Backend logs:**
```
ðŸ”§ Creating worker for run [runId] using path: [workerPath]
âœ… Worker created successfully for run [runId]
ðŸ“¤ Sending start message to worker for run [runId]
ðŸ“¥ [RunManager] Received message from worker for run [runId]: log
ðŸ“Š [RunManager] Received progress for run [runId]: [data]
ðŸ“Š [WebSocket] Broadcasting progress for run [runId]: [data]
```

**Worker logs:**
```
ðŸ”§ [Worker runId] Worker initialized and listening for messages
ðŸ“¥ [Worker runId] Received message: start
ðŸš€ [Worker runId] Starting load test for spec: [specName]
ðŸ“¤ [Worker runId] Sending update: progress [data]
```

### 4. Check Real-time Data Flow
Monitor the complete flow:
1. Worker sends progress updates every second
2. RunManager receives and emits events
3. WebSocket server broadcasts to clients
4. Frontend receives and displays updates

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: No real-time data in frontend
**Check:**
1. WebSocket connection status in browser console
2. Backend logs for event emission
3. Network tab for WebSocket messages
4. Run ID matching between frontend and backend

### Issue: Load test not starting
**Check:**
1. Worker creation logs
2. Worker path resolution
3. Spec validation
4. MongoDB connection

### Issue: Events not reaching WebSocket clients
**Check:**
1. RunManager event emission logs
2. WebSocket server event reception logs
3. Client room joining logs
4. CORS configuration

## Testing Commands

### Test WebSocket Connectivity:
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/api/test-websocket
```

### Test Complete System:
```bash
cd backend
node test-load-system.js
```

### Check Health:
```bash
curl http://localhost:3001/api/health
```

## Environment Variables

### Backend:
```env
PORT=3001
WEBSOCKET_PORT=3002
MONGO_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/loadforge
MAX_WORKERS=4
MAX_SOCKETS=1000
NODE_ENV=development
```

### Frontend:
```env
VITE_BACKEND_URL=http://localhost:3001
VITE_WEBSOCKET_URL=http://localhost:3002
```

## Architecture Benefits

1. **Separation of Concerns**: API and WebSocket traffic are isolated
2. **Better Performance**: Load testing doesn't interfere with real-time updates
3. **Scalability**: Each server can be scaled independently
4. **Debugging**: Clear separation makes issues easier to identify
5. **Reliability**: WebSocket connections remain stable during heavy load testing

## Next Steps

1. Run the test script to verify the system works
2. Start a load test and monitor all debug logs
3. Check frontend real-time updates
4. Verify that load testing requests appear in backend logs
5. Confirm that progress data flows correctly to the frontend
